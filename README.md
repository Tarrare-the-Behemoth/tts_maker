Recreate the voice of any person (maybe)
[Instructions:]

Step 1:
Record your target, e.g Yourself, until you are fairly confident they have said every sound in the alphabet (and a breath)  
Make sure to save ~0.25 to ~0.5s of no noise. This will be a space.

Step 2:
Use an audio processor, e.g. Audacity, to get each sound of the alphabet and export them separately.

Put all these files in the format: '\[letter\].\[format\]', e.g. 'a.wav'
The breath must be named 'period.\[format\]' and the space will be 'space.\[format\]'

Step 4:
Put all these files in the same directory as audacious.py the RUN IT.

Step 5:
Enter the text you want it to say.

Step 6:
It will give a sound file named  'output.\[format\]' and that will be the final result.
